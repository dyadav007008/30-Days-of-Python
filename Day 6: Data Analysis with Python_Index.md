2. Introduction
2.1 What is data analysis 
2.2 Data analysis tools 
2.3 Data analysis process 
2.4 Data Analysis vs Data Science 
2.5 Python and PyData Ecosystem
2.6 Python data analysis vs Excel 
3. Real example data analysis with Python: getting a sense of what you can learn from this course 
4. How to use Jupyter Notebooks 
5. Intro to NumPy 
5.1 Low-level basis: binary numbers, memory footprint 
5.2 Python is not memory efficient to store numbers since it wraps everything into objects. Whereas in NumPy, we can select the number of bits to represent numbers
5.3 NumPy can compute arrays faster than Python 
5.4 NumPy tutorial: NumPy arrays, matrices 
5.5 Memory footprint and performance: Python vs NumPy 
6. Intro to Pandas: getting, processing and visualizing data
6.1 Pandas data structure: Series 
6.2 We can change the index of Pandas series and this is fundamentally different from NumPy arrays 
6.3 The upper limit of slicing in Pandas series is included, whereas, in NumPy, the limit is excluded 
6.4 Pandas data structure: DataFrames 
6.5 Most operations in Pandas are immutable 
6.7 Reading external data 
6.8 Pandas plotting 
7. Data cleaning 
7.1 Handling miss data 
7.2 Cleaning invalidate values 
7.3 Handling duplicated data 
7.4 Handling text data 
7.5 Data visualization 
7.6 Matplotlib global API
7.7 Matplotlib OOP API  
8. Working with data from(/to) SQL, CSV, txt, API etc. 
8.1 Python methods for working with files 
8.2 Python methods for working with CSV files 
8.3 Pandas methods for working with CSV files 
8.4 Python methods for working with SQL 
8.5 Pandas methods for working with SQL
