## Control Structures and Functions
Control structures are the essence of programming; they help computers do what they do best: automate repetitive tasks intelligently. The most common control structures are if-else statements, for and while loops, and list and dictionary comprehensions. This session will cover all these concepts.


## Relational Operators:

- Compares the values on either side of the operator and returns and boolean value as True or False.

- ##### ' = ' is an assignment operator; it is used to assign value to a variable on the left.

- ##### '==' is a relational operator; it is used for comparision of equality.


| Operator | Name                     | Example | Result if, x=10, y = 10 | Result if, x=10, y = 11 |
|----------|--------------------------|---------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| ==       | Equal                    | x == y  | TRUE                    | FALSE                   |
| !=       | Not equal                | x != y  | FALSE                   | TRUE                    |
| >        | Greater than             | x > y   | FALSE                   | FALSE                   |
| <        | Less than                | x < y   | FALSE                   | TRUE                    |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to | x >= y  | TRUE                    | FALSE                   |
| <=       | Less than or equal to    | x <= y  | TRUE                    | TRUE                    |



## Decision Making: If else Statements

If a condition is met then the action is executed.
Relational operators are used to test equality or inequality of a condition and that condition might change based on your preference.

Example -
If its raining == True:
  THEN I'll get an umbrella

SYNTAX:

```python
if condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if the condition is False
```

### Check if the number entered from the user is greater than 99 or not:

```python
### Check if the number entered from the user is greater than 99 or not:
num = int(input("Enter the number"))
if(num > 99):
    print("Number is Greater than 99")
else:
    print("Number is smaller than 99")
```

## Decision Making: If else Statements

- ### Check if the number entered from the user is greater than 100,1000 or not:

```python
# elif Statement
num = int(input("Enter the number"))
if(num == 1000):
    print("Number is Equal to 1000")
elif(num > 1000):
    print("Number is Greater than 1000")
elif(num == 100):
    print("Number is Equal to 100")
elif(num > 100):
    print("Number is Greater than 100")
else:
    print("Number is smaller than 100")
```

**Logical Operators**

| Operator | Description                                             | Example               |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| and      | Returns True if both statements are true                | x < 5 andÂ  x < 10     |
| or       | Returns True if one of the statements is true           | x < 5 or x < 4        |
| not      | Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true | not(x < 5 and x < 10) |


**Bitwise Operators**

| Operator | Name                 | Description                                                                                             | Example |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| &        | AND                  | Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1                                                                   | x & y   |
| |        | OR                   | Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1                                                              | x | y   |
| ^        | XOR                  | Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1                                                         | x ^ y   |
| ~        | NOT                  | Inverts all the bits                                                                                    | ~x      |
| <<       | Zero fill left shift | Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off                        | x << 2  |
| >>       | Signed right shift   | Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off | x >> 2  |

- # Write a program which offers various discount on purchase bills.

  ```python
shoppinng_total = 550

if shoppinng_total >= 500:
    print("You won a discount voucher of flat 15% on next purchase")
elif shoppinng_total >= 250:
    print("You won a discount voucher of flat 10% on next purchase")
elif shoppinng_total >= 100:
    print("You won a discount voucher of flat 5% on next purchase")    
else:
    print("OOPS!! no discount for you!!!")
  ```

shoppinng_total = 550

if shoppinng_total >= 500:
    print("You won a discount voucher of flat 1000 on next purchase")
elif shoppinng_total >= 250:
    print("You won a discount voucher of flat 500 on next purchase")
elif shoppinng_total >= 100:
    print("You won a discount voucher of flat 100 on next purchase")    
else:
    print("OOPS!! no discount for you!!!")

```

## Loops and Iteration and Python

### While Loop


Syntax:
while condition:
    # Code to execute as long as the condition is True

```python
x = 0

while x < 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1  # Increment x by 1 each time
```

## Check if the pin entered by the user is valid or not. If not let the user try again

```python
pin = input("Enter the 4 digit pin")
while pin != '1234':
    pin = input("!Invalid Pin. Try again")
print("Pin validation Successful")
```



## Lets try to add max of 3 tries and if user fails to identify . we will print a message of attempted tries
```python
attempt = 0
max_attempt = 3
correct_pin = '1234'
while attempt < max_attempt:
    pin = input("Enter the 4 digit pin: ")
    if(pin == correct_pin):
        print("Pin Validation Successfull")
        break
    else:
        attempt += 1
        if attempt < max_attempt:
            print(f"!Invalid Pin. You have {max_attempt - attempt} tries left.")
        else:
            print("Maximum attempts reached. You have been locked out.")
```


## for loop:
