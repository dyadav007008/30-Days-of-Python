## Control Structures and Functions
Control structures are the essence of programming; they help computers do what they do best: automate repetitive tasks intelligently. The most common control structures are if-else statements, for and while loops, and list and dictionary comprehensions. This session will cover all these concepts.


## Relational Operators:

- Compares the values on either side of the operator and returns and boolean value as True or False.

- ##### ' = ' is an assignment operator; it is used to assign value to a variable on the left.

- ##### '==' is a relational operator; it is used for comparision of equality.


| Operator | Name                     | Example | Result if, x=10, y = 10 | Result if, x=10, y = 11 |
|----------|--------------------------|---------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| ==       | Equal                    | x == y  | TRUE                    | FALSE                   |
| !=       | Not equal                | x != y  | FALSE                   | TRUE                    |
| >        | Greater than             | x > y   | FALSE                   | FALSE                   |
| <        | Less than                | x < y   | FALSE                   | TRUE                    |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to | x >= y  | TRUE                    | FALSE                   |
| <=       | Less than or equal to    | x <= y  | TRUE                    | TRUE                    |



## Decision Making: If else Statements

If a condition is met then the action is executed.
Relational operators are used to test equality or inequality of a condition and that condition might change based on your preference.

Example -
If its raining == True:
  THEN I'll get an umbrella

SYNTAX:

```python
if condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if the condition is False
```

### Check if the number entered from the user is greater than 99 or not:

```python
### Check if the number entered from the user is greater than 99 or not:
num = int(input("Enter the number"))
if(num > 99):
    print("Number is Greater than 99")
else:
    print("Number is smaller than 99")
```

## Decision Making: If else Statements

- ### Check if the number entered from the user is greater than 100,1000 or not:

```python
# elif Statement
num = int(input("Enter the number"))
if(num == 1000):
    print("Number is Equal to 1000")
elif(num > 1000):
    print("Number is Greater than 1000")
elif(num == 100):
    print("Number is Equal to 100")
elif(num > 100):
    print("Number is Greater than 100")
else:
    print("Number is smaller than 100")
```

**Logical Operators**

| Operator | Description                                             | Example               |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| and      | Returns True if both statements are true                | x < 5 andÂ  x < 10     |
| or       | Returns True if one of the statements is true           | x < 5 or x < 4        |
| not      | Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true | not(x < 5 and x < 10) |


**Bitwise Operators**

| Operator | Name                 | Description                                                                                             | Example |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| &        | AND                  | Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1                                                                   | x & y   |
| |        | OR                   | Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1                                                              | x | y   |
| ^        | XOR                  | Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1                                                         | x ^ y   |
| ~        | NOT                  | Inverts all the bits                                                                                    | ~x      |
| <<       | Zero fill left shift | Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off                        | x << 2  |
| >>       | Signed right shift   | Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off | x >> 2  |

- # Write a program which offers various discount on purchase bills.

  ```python
shoppinng_total = 550

if shoppinng_total >= 500:
    print("You won a discount voucher of flat 15% on next purchase")
elif shoppinng_total >= 250:
    print("You won a discount voucher of flat 10% on next purchase")
elif shoppinng_total >= 100:
    print("You won a discount voucher of flat 5% on next purchase")

```

## Loops and Iteration and Python

### While Loop


Syntax:
while condition:
    # Code to execute as long as the condition is True

```python
x = 0

while x < 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1  # Increment x by 1 each time
```

## Check if the pin entered by the user is valid or not. If not let the user try again

```python
pin = input("Enter the 4 digit pin")
while pin != '1234':
    pin = input("!Invalid Pin. Try again")
print("Pin validation Successful")
```



## Lets try to add max of 3 tries and if user fails to identify . we will print a message of attempted tries
```python
attempt = 0
max_attempt = 3
correct_pin = '1234'
while attempt < max_attempt:
    pin = input("Enter the 4 digit pin: ")
    if(pin == correct_pin):
        print("Pin Validation Successfull")
        break
    else:
        attempt += 1
        if attempt < max_attempt:
            print(f"!Invalid Pin. You have {max_attempt - attempt} tries left.")
        else:
            print("Maximum attempts reached. You have been locked out.")
```


## for loop:

```python
# for loop
# iterate over a list of string
a = "One Piece is the best anime in the world"
for var in a:
    print(var,end=':')
```

```python
# for loop
# iterate over a list of string
a = "One Piece is the best anime in the world"
for var in a:
    print(var)
```

```python
# Iterating over dictionary

student_data = {1:["deepak",10],2:["Juhi",15],3:["Harshita",29],4:["Kalpana",40],5:["Robert Downy Jr",3000]}
student_data
for key, val in student_data.items():
    print(key, val)

```

Output:
1 ['deepak', 10]
2 ['Juhi', 15]
3 ['Harshita', 29]
4 ['Kalpana', 40]
5 ['Robert Downy Jr', 3000]


Range:

```python
# range
for i in range(1,5):
    print(i,end = ',')
```
Output: 1,2,3,4,5
```python
list1 = [1,4,2,6,4,7,8]

for i in range(len(list1)):
    print(list1[i])
```

Output :
1
4
2
6
4
7
8

```python
print(list(range(1,100,2))) # print range of 1 to 100 with a skip step of 2
```

Output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99]

## check if a number is prime or not:

```python
# Function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# List to store prime numbers
prime_numbers = []

# Loop through numbers from 1 to 20
for number in range(1, 21):
    if is_prime(number):
        prime_numbers.append(number)

print("Prime numbers between 1 and 20:", prime_numbers)
```

Prime numbers between 1 and 20: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]


## Comprehensions

li = ["Arun","Deepak","Joker","Mohit","Shubham","Chahat"]


## List Comprehensions:

```python
# Functional Approach:
# List Comprehension
L2 = [len(word) for word in li]
l2
```


```python
# iterating over li and l2 simutaneously

for i,j in zip(li,l2):
    print(i," - ", j)
```

Output:
Arun  -  4
Deepak  -  6
Joker  -  5
Mohit  -  5
Shubham  -  7
Chahat  -  6


## Dictionary Comprehension:

```python
## dicionary comrehension
d = {word:len(word) for word in li}
d
```
{'Arun': 4, 'Deepak': 6, 'Joker': 5, 'Mohit': 5, 'Shubham': 7, 'Chahat': 6}



## Set Comprehension
## Write a program which takes a word as input from user and returns vowels from the word 

```python
# Set Comprehension
# Write a program which takes a word as input from user and returns vowels from the word 
word = input("Enter a word: ")
vowels = {char for char in word if char in "aeiouAEIOU"}
vowels
```
Output:
Enter a word:  dEEPAK
{'A', 'E'}
